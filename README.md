# Correlation modelling functions
This repository provides python scripts to calculate different correlation coefficients. Here it can be found inter/intra-IM non-spatial correlation models and inter/intra-IM spatial correlation models.
All the citations of each model presented in this repository are included within the python scripts and showed below.

For a more detailed review of the ground motion correlation modelling for regional seismic risk analysis please see the paper cited below:
